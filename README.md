# Classification of Iris Species Using Machine Learning

Objective:

To build a machine learning model to classify Iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on the features of the dataset.
Dataset:

The Iris dataset, available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each with 4 features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
Steps and Description:

###Data Exploration and Visualization:
Load the Iris dataset and understand its structure.
Visualize the data using pair plots, histograms, and box plots to understand the distribution and relationship between features.

###Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values (if any).
Encode categorical labels (species) into numerical values.
Split the data into training and testing sets.

###Model Building:
Implement several classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
Train each model on the training data.

###Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Use cross-validation to ensure the models are not overfitting.
Compare the performance of different models.

###Hyperparameter Tuning:
Perform hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search or Random Search to optimize the models.

###Final Model Selection:
Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
Save the model for future use.

###Visualization:
Visualize the performance of the models using confusion matrices and ROC curves.
Plot feature importance for the best model (if applicable).

###Conclusion:
Summarize findings and discuss the performance of different models.
Provide insights on the most important features for classifying iris species.
